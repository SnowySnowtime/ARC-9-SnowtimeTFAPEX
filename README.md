# ARC9-SnowtimeTFAPEX
An addon for ARC9 which plans to port Titanfall 2 weaponry and its Apex Legends equivalents to Garry's Mod.
If an Apex Legends exclusive weapon exists, it will still be ported.

If possible, weapons will be handled like a family tree similar to COD MWII, where if you want say a Longbow, you'll need to grab a starting point weapon (R99, in this case) and then apply the conversion.

# Support
If you wish to support the addons development, let me know. There are many things that I want to do but dont have time for considering im just a single person working on these from scratch.

# TO-DO
